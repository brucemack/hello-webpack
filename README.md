Overview
--------

A basic "hello world" that provides the shell of an application developed
using React.JS/Node.JS.  Webpack is the most important tool being demonstrated,
but there are many other tools involved.  

Getting Setup
-------------

# Git checkout
# (If necessary) npm install -g nodemon
# (If necessary) npm install -g webpack
# Type: npm install
# Get the Node.JS server running in one window: node app-server/index.js
# Get the Webpack development server running in another window: npm run dev
# Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

This will run the application in an iframe with auto update for very fast
development (i.e. application reloads after any file is updated).
